# RETAIN-heart-failure-RNN
A recurrent neural network to predict heart failure based on ICD-9 data analysis. Implementation of [RETAIN: An Interpretable Predictive Model for Healthcare using Reverse Time Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05745)

- *It's one of my homework made through Deep Learning for Healthcare course. I've been playing around with code because it introduced a few new things.*
- *Its dataset is relatively small for the purpose of the assignment and the training never reached 90% (best result so far is 85%).*
- *I can't upload the original notebook due to Coursera Honor Code (Course is a part of MSc in Computer Science). Belive it or not - the code quality there is mediocre and sometimes it's difficult to understand what's going on.*
- *There are possible improvements, such as predict stage and probaby more.*
