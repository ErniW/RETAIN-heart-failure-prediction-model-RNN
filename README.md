# RETAIN-heart-failure-RNN
A recurrent neural network to predict heart failure based on ICD-9 data analysis. Implementation of [RETAIN: An Interpretable Predictive Model for Healthcare using Reverse Time Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05745)

- *It's one of my homework made through Deep Learning for Healthcare course. I've been playing around with code because I've never worked with Torch.*
- *Its dataset is relatively small and the training never reached 90% (best result so far is 85%)*
